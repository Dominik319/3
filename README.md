## General Information
- The aim of the project is to illustrate the course of the robot on a graph and on the plane of the directions of the world. The interference in the performed actions is marginal, limited to manipulating the graph presentation.


## Technologies Used
- c++
- Winapi


## Features
-draw the graph 
-show the current robot's posiotion
-show direction of the robot movement on the compass.

## Usage
The program gets the information about the angular position of  the robot. And with these information draw the position to time graph and compass of current angle of robot.
Using different buttons you can manipulate the appearance of the graph. Here it is what is every button for:
"Generuj" - draw graph and compass using features you chose
"reset" - reset the settings of the graph
"Amplituda up" - increase of the graphs amplitude 
-"Amplituda normal" - reset the ampltude of the graph
"Amplituda down" - decrease of the graph amplitude
"Przyspieszenie 2ms" - increase of the speed of incoming information
"Spowolnienie 2ms" - decrease of the speed of incoming information
"ilosc probek +50" - increase the number of rejected samples
"ilosc probek -50" - decrease the number of rejected samples
Additionaly you can see current number of the rejected samples, time intervals between samples, increase height of the graph and time intervals on the graph.


## Project Status
Project is: complete 


## Room for Improvement
Program could have more funcionalities and features
